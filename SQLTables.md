# Tables Needed For Golf Green

Given that each player user will need to search a location, followed by the actual course it self, I do feel that
a minimum of two tables will be required.  In the first table it will outline the city you are searching in, the number of courses
and of course the number of courses.  **See table 1.1** for an example.

| City Names    | City Location | Num of Course|
| :-----------: |:-------------:| :-----------:|
| Albuquerque   | Coordinates   |       8      |
| Santa Fe      | Coordinates   |       4      |
| Las Cruces    | Coordinates   |       3      |
**Table 1.1**

The second table will need to then pull the course names, price, booking info, and difficulty based on the location of
the course's city.  See *table 1.2** for an example.

| Course Names  |     Price     | Booking Info |  Difficulty |
| :-----------: |:-------------:| :-----------:| :----------:|
| Arroyo Del Oso| $35 / $45     | phone number |    6/10     |
| UNM North     | $15 / $28     | phone number |    6/10     |
| UNM South     | $65           | phone number |    8/10     |
