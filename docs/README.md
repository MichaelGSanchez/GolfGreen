**What will your app be called?**

The app that I am purposing will currently be called, GolfGreen.
The reason behind the name is due to the apps ability to save
the consumer "green" whilst on the links. 

**What is the basic functionality of the app?**

The main functionality of the app is be to be a hub of
information for all golfers. The info that will be provided
will be pricing, golf course contact info, a link to the golf course site,
golf course difficulty, and layout of the course. You will be able 
to search using your location, or search for courses in a city or town 
that you may be traveling to.

**Who would find this app useful or fun, and when would they use it?**

* User Story 1, The Avid Golfer
    
   Avid golfers are very committed to the game and will go to any length to play. 
   Some of these avid golfers will play no matter what the weather is, or where 
   they are.  However, these avid golfers typically have to search in many outdated
   websites to check prices, book tee times, find out the level of difficulty, or 
   just find a number to the golf course.  Often, these golfers know most of the prices
   and info round their own town.  However, these golfers are known to want to play
   in other cities.  In their case, it would be very useful to not have to check 
   multiple sites, but rather have all of the information they are looking for stored in
   one place.  This is where the GolfGreen app comes into play. These avid golfers could 
   explore course around the world and have the info that they need.  If GolfGreen wanted 
   to take it a step further, the app could even send info to these users (should the users
   opt in to receive deals) about golf deals in their area or around the world! 

* User Story 2, The Beginning Golfer

   The beauty of GolfGreen, is it has the capacity to reach many different users. 
   This also includes beginning golfers! As a beginning golfer, it can be very intimidating
   to want to give the game a try.  However, GolfGreen will not only show the 
   green fees, location and pricing, it will also rate the golf courses difficulty. For a beginner,
   that is a very helpful hint and helps take away the intimidation factor. 
   Housing everything in one central location is helpful for all! 

**Could the app be useful on its own, with not connection to the Internet?**

The app could be useful if the user off line, they are able to download the info for the selected area into a PDF
while they have an Internet connection.  The app for the most part would be dependent on the users access to 
Internet connection. 

**What sort of data would this app use or share if it had a connection to the Internet?**

The data shared would be the location and ability to load different menu's that contain the information they are looking for.
